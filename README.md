> Pay your tuition at the right time — not just on time.

Exchange rates change daily. For international students paying large sums like tuition, even a small shift can mean hundreds of dollars lost. RateReady predicts the optimal day to pay based on your deadline and home currency, and surfaces the recommendation directly on your university's payment portal.

## Why not just pay automatically?

We considered it. University portals don't expose payment APIs, and automating cross-border transfers requires banking integrations that are out of scope for a student tool. Instead, we pass the responsibility to the human — if something unexpected happens (a geopolitical event, a sudden rate swing), you're always in control of when you actually pay.

This same approach applies beyond tuition: rent, flights home, any large payment with a deadline.
